> When modeling a phenomenon, understand the phenomenon you’re modeling and your goal in modeling it, then choose a rich-enough abstraction, and then choose adequate representations to capture your abstraction within the bounds of your resources. Once this is done, test to verify that your abstraction was appropriate.\ 
> Consider the impact of the human visual system on your problem and its models.

**Human Eye** \
- Angular Resolution: 300 mm/1km or 0.3mm/1m
- the eye is very sensitive to motion, so two adjacent pixels in a gray region that alternately ﬂash white may give an illusion of motion that’s easily detectable, which might be useful for attracting the user’s attention.
